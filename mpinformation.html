      	</div>
      	<div class="modal-body">
      	<h5> What is bipolar disorder?</h5>
        <p>Bipolar disorder is grouped as a subset of depression, characterized by extreme mood swings between periods of 
        exhaustion and depression and those of high-energy euphoria (mania). The mood shifts can occur over months or during
         the course of a week. </p>
         <br>
         <h5>What do the shifts involve?</h5>
		<p>During the mania phase, a person can feel euphoria and high energy. However, this often goes too far and leads to 
		irritability and dangerous, reckless behavior. A person with bipolar disorder can also experience hypomania, a mild 
		type of mania that doesnâ€™t involve psychosis.</p>
		<p>After mania comes a depressed phase, in which a person can have depressive symptoms so bad that they cannot leave bed. </p>
		<br>
		<h5> Treatment and Types</h5>
		<p>There are several types of bipolar disorders: bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymic disorder. Each one can
		 be treated but treatment must be ongoing for life. Bipolar disorder is a chronic illness and will only worsen
		  with time if untreated.</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title">Learn About: Stress</h4>
      	</div>
      	<div class="modal-body">
        <p>Stress is usually described as an overwhelming feeling produced in response to stressors (Events, objects, people 
        that cause you stress) that invoke the fight or flight response; resulting in the release of adrenaline and cortisol.
          Throughout life, we continually analyze particular situations, people, and events to determine if our skill set and 
          mental capacity are capable of confronting this situation. When we are stressed, we have carefully analyzed a
           particular situation and deemed ourselves lacking the tools to tackle this challenge and thus feel some sort of 
           stress and anxiety over the situation. Logically speaking, stress is truly imperative to life; originating in our 
           primitive instincts to  fight or escape in reaction to some imminent threat, and motivating us to survive some 
           situation our brain interpret as a threat.  So while low-levels of stress can be viewed as helpful in boosting 
           brainpower and focus, too much of anything can be harmful, and stress is no exception. High levels of stress 
           lead to heart disease, a weaker immune system, and  increase aging.
